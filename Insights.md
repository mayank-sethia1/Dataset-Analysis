Here are my top findings from the recent user data, along with a few concrete actions we can take to improve sales and customer experience.

* **Fix the Leaky Cart.** Our biggest problem is cart abandonment. On both mobile and desktop, over 60% of users who add an item to their cart leave before completing the purchase. This is the most critical drop-off point to fix. We should immediately look at simplifying our checkout process by offering a guest option and showing all costs upfront.  
* **Help Customers Decide.** The second major hurdle is getting customers to add items to their cart. After looking at a product, more than 40% of users navigate away. The chat logs confirm this hesitation and most messages are about searching for, comparing, and getting details on products. We need to make our product pages more compelling to help users make a confident choice.  
* **Improve Post-Purchase Communication.** A significant number of support messages are from customers simply asking "where is my order?‚Äù. The `track_order` intent is one of the most common, which suggests our tracking page or automated email updates aren't clear enough. We can reduce support load by making order tracking information more proactive and easier for customers to find themselves.  
* **Clarify the Cancellation Window.** We have a potential issue with our cancellation policy. Half of all cancellations are happening outside the 60-minute window. This suggests that the policy might be confusing to customers or the process to cancel is not straightforward enough.

### **Experiment Proposal**

**Experiment**: I recommend we run an A/B test on a redesigned checkout page that prioritizes a one-page, guest checkout flow against our current multi-step process.

**Success Metric**: We will track the **conversion rate from 'Clicks' to 'Purchase'**. A successful experiment will show a significant increase in this metric, confirming that a simpler flow reduces abandonment.
